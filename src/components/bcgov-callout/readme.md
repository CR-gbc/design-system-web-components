# Callout
Callouts are an excerpt of text that has been pulled out and used as a visual clue to draw the eye to the text. They are used to help direct a user's attention to important pieces of information.

## Use This For

Differentiating a block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:
* Important snippets of information
* Quotes
* Examples
* Additional information about the page

## Don’t Use this For
* Warning notifications
* Page alerts

## Design Guidance
* Use callouts very sparingly - it’s less effective if it’s overused.

## CMS Lite Users

## Accessibility

### Colour Contrast
* Text on the gray background meets contrast requirements
* The thick left border conveys information using more than just colour

```html
<bcgov-callout>Callout Message</bcgov-callout>
```

<bcgov-callout>Callout Message</bcgov-callout>
